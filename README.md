# TensorFlowIrisDataSet
TensorFlow Problem sheet: Using Tensorflow to determine the species of test iris data

## Our objectives for this Problem sheet were:

Problem set: Tensorflow

These problems relate to the Python package Tensorflow. We will again use the famous iris data set. Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository. Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.

1. Use Tensorflow to create model

Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

2. Split the data into training and testing

Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

3. Train the model

Use the testing set to train your model.

4. Test the model

Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.

## In my Jupyter Notebook you able to view the solutions for these questions

## How to use my solution on Jupyter NoteBook 

1. Firstly download anaconda in order to code in python. You can download anaconda through this link and following their instructions: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

2. Download my repository to your computer using clone or download methods

3. When you downloaded anaconda you will have recieved a anaconda terminal called anaconda prompt. if you search on your computer it should pop up. Once open navigate to your repository where my download is. 

4. Once in the directory type the command "Jupyter Notebook". This shall open a browser displaying your Jupyter notebook folder. Then just click on IrisDataSet.ipynb and the solutions should be there. With Jupyter notebook you will be able to manipulate the data and change the code.

5. Alternatively if you just want to click on my IrisDataSet.ipynb on my github repository it will bring us to a non editable version. But here you can view the code and the data.
